# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
## 📌 Overview

This project predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on clinical features such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc.
It uses Machine Learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.) to classify patients as having heart disease (1) or not (0).
